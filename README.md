About The Project: We're building a tool to help clients onboard human developers and pay them for pieces of work done.

Why It Matters: Clients use various code gen tools to build software e.g; copilot, cursor, replit but these tools often generate some buggy code that needs human insight and creativity to fix. Our platform lets clients onboard a human in the loop to support these LLMs in edge cases like this.

Who's It For: Clients who use code gen tools to build software and need human creativity to create a better output.

What's The Use Case: Clients sign up and create a contract to define the required developer role, pay and tech stack then submit it. The tool will automatically onboard a human to add to the desired codebase via Github or IDE.
